# Roadmap

These are some of the functions we are working on implementing in the near future. 

- New APIs to load videos from a supported video URL (mp4, m3u8, etc).
- HTML5 video format: allows you to load videos of different formats depending on the browser support (mp4, ogv, webm, etc).
- Adding unit tests for `paella-core` public APIs.
- npm command `create-paella-app`: allows to create a basic npm project from several templates (vanillajs, React, Svelte, etc.).
- WebGL video canvas: needed to support other video canvas, such as video 360º.

Note: The order may vary and new functions with higher priority may appear.
